C. Confidentiality

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal Answer and Rationale</summary>

**Answer: C. Confidentiality**

**Rationale:** Confidentiality ensures that data is kept private and viewed only by authorized users, often enforced through encryption and strong access controls.

#### 2. OSI Model

If a cyber attacker tries to overwhelm a web application server with HTTP/HTTPS requests, which OSI Model layer is the target?

A. Layer 3 (Network)
B. Layer 7 (Application)
C. Layer 1 (Physical)

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal Answer and Rationale</summary>

**Answer: B. Layer 7 (Application)**

**Rationale:** Layer 7 is where applications (like web browsers and servers) operate, making it the target for application-layer DDoS attacks that focus on web services (HTTP/HTTPS).

#### 3. Threat Actors

What is the primary motivation driving a **cybercriminal**?

A. To promote a political or social cause (Hacktivism).
B. Personal interest, notoriety, or technical challenge.
C. To obtain financial gain or profit.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal Answer and Rationale</summary>

**Answer: C. To obtain financial gain or profit.**

**Rationale:** Unlike hacktivists or nation-state actors, cybercriminals are overwhelmingly motivated by monetary gain.

#### 4. Data Types

In cybersecurity, what term describes data that is stored on a device (like a hard drive or database) and is not actively being transmitted?

A. Data in Transit
B. Data in Use
C. Data at Rest

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal Answer and Rationale</summary>

**Answer: C. Data at Rest**

**Rationale:** Data at rest refers to inactive data stored physically, while Data in Transit is actively moving across a network.
</details>

#### 5. Attacks

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is often carried out using a **Botnet**. What is a Botnet?

A. A single, powerful computer used to launch attacks.
B. A network of compromised computers that work together to launch an attack.
C. A type of malicious software that encrypts user files.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal Answer and Rationale</summary>

**Answer: B. A network of compromised computers that work together to launch an attack.**

**Rationale:** A botnet is a collective army of 'zombie' computers remotely controlled by an attacker to launch coordinated, massive attacks like DDoS.
</details>

#### 6. Hacking Roles

What type of hacker works to improve an organization's security defenses, operating **legally and ethically**?

A. Black Hat Hacker
B. Grey Hat Hacker
C. White Hat Hacker

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal Answer and Rationale</summary>

**Answer: C. White Hat Hacker**

**Rationale:** White Hat hackers (ethical hackers) operate with permission to test and improve systems, contrasting with the malicious intent of Black Hat hackers.
</details>

#### 7. Device Security

What is the main security risk associated with the use of **Smart Devices** (IoT) in the home?

A. The devices consume too much electricity.
B. The constant collection and transmission of personal data to third parties.
C. They frequently disrupt Wi-Fi network connections.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal Answer and Rationale</summary>

**Answer: B. The constant collection and transmission of personal data to third parties.**

**Rationale:** IoT devices often collect large amounts of sensitive data (video, audio, location) which can be a privacy risk due to weak security controls.
</details>

<br>

#### 8. Cyber Risk

In cybersecurity risk management, what is a **Vulnerability**?

A. The person or group launching an attack.
B. A weakness in the system's code or design that can be exploited.
C. The potential damage or loss resulting from an incident.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal Answer and Rationale</summary>

**Answer: B. A weakness in the system's code or design that can be exploited.**

**Rationale:** A vulnerability is a flaw (the weakness), while the threat is the potential attacker, and the risk is the potential damage.
</details>

#### 9. Authentication vs. Authorization

When a system verifies a user's identity (e.g., by checking a username and password), which process is taking place?

A. Authorization
B. Authentication
C. Encryption

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal Answer and Rationale</summary>

**Answer: B. Authentication**

**Rationale:** Authentication is proving *who* you are. Authorization is determining *what* you can do after being authenticated.
</details>

#### 10. Cyber Warfare

The Stuxnet worm demonstrated that a cyberattack can be primarily used to:

A. Steal credit card data for the black market.
B. Disrupt or damage **critical infrastructure** systems (like industrial or power plants).
C. Collect personal identities on a large scale.

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal Answer and Rationale</summary>

**Answer: B. Disrupt or damage critical infrastructure systems.**

**Rationale:** Cyber warfare typically targets critical infrastructure for strategic, political, or military gains, as seen with Stuxnet's targeting of Iranian centrifuges.
</details>

**Answer: B. Disrupt or damage critical infrastructure systems (like industrial or power plants).**

**Rationale:** Cyber warfare typically targets critical infrastructure for strategic, political, or military gains, as seen with Stuxnet's targeting of Iranian centrifuges.
